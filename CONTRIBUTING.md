## Commit Etiquette

Good git history is important as reviewable code is ultimately how we ensure the security of Enki. The following set of guidelines regarding git commits should be followed when contributing to the Enki project.

* Git commits should follow [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). A brief summary is as follows:

  * Separate subject from body with a blank line
  * Limit the subject line to 50 characters
  * Capitalize the subject line
  * Do not end the subject line with a period
  * Use the imperative mood in the subject line
  * Wrap the body at 72 characters
  * Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
* Use squashes to clean up your commit history - Forcing pushes is allowed
* Do not squash commits inside a pull request, as this interferes with the review process

## Submitting changes
